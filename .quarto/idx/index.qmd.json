It's always intersting that even payment methods like [![Apple Pay](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apple%20Pay-000?logo=applepay&logoColor=fff)](#), [![MasterCard](https://img.shields.io/badge/MasterCard-EB001B?logo=mastercard&logoColor=fff)](#), \n[![Visa](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visa-1A1F71?logo=visa&logoColor=fff)](#), \n[![American Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/American%20Express-2E77BC?logo=americanexpress&logoColor=fff)](#), \nand [![PayPal](https://img.shields.io/badge/PayPal-003087?logo=paypal&logoColor=fff)](#)\nall get their own badges. I'm a fan of [![Doordash](https://img.shields.io/badge/DoorDash-FF3008?logo=DoorDash&logoColor=white)](#), preferring it over [![Uber Eats](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uber_Eats-5FB709?logo=uber-eats&logoColor=white)](#) and [![Just Eat](https://img.shields.io/badge/Just%20Eat-F36D00?logo=justeat&logoColor=fff)](#), but that's just my preference. These badges are fun to play around with...\n\n\n# 📧 Contact\n\n- **Email:** [mingjia.guan@outlook.com](mailto:mingjia.guan@outlook.com)\n- **LinkedIn:** [Mingjia “Jacky” Guan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mingjia-jacky-guan/)\n<!-- - **GitHub:** [mxngjxa](https://github.com/mxngjxa) -->\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"brand":{"light":{"data":{"meta":{"name":{"full":"Mingjia \"Jacky\" Guan","short":"Jacky Guan"},"link":{"github":"https://github.com/mxngjxa","linkedin":"https://linkedin.com/in/mingjia-jacky-guan"},"description":"'Mingjia \"Jacky\" Guan is a Machine Learning Engineer at Deledao Technologies.
