I'm even thinking of writing a package and publishing it to [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPI-3775A9?logo=pypi&logoColor=fff)](#). \nOf course, while [![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-000000?logo=apple&logoColor=F0F0F0)](#)\noffers the best UI experience with good old [![Homebrew](https://img.shields.io/badge/Homebrew-FBB040?logo=homebrew&logoColor=fff)](#), \nI work mostly in [![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?logo=linux&logoColor=black)](#), \nstaying close to traditional flavors like [![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white)](#). In any case, something about [![Windows](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Windows-0078D6?logo=windows11&logoColor=white)](#)\ncreeps me out. \n\nAt the core, I code mostly with [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=fff)](#). It is a good language, unlike [![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-%23276DC3.svg?logo=r&logoColor=white)](#), \nand much preferred over, [![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=000)](#)\n(or [![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?logo=typescript&logoColor=fff)](#), since it is the way to go).

It's always intersting that even payment methods like [![Apple Pay](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apple%20Pay-000?logo=applepay&logoColor=fff)](#), [![MasterCard](https://img.shields.io/badge/MasterCard-EB001B?logo=mastercard&logoColor=fff)](#), \n[![Visa](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visa-1A1F71?logo=visa&logoColor=fff)](#), \n[![American Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/American%20Express-2E77BC?logo=americanexpress&logoColor=fff)](#), \nand [![PayPal](https://img.shields.io/badge/PayPal-003087?logo=paypal&logoColor=fff)](#)\nall get their own badges. I'm a fan of [![Doordash](https://img.shields.io/badge/DoorDash-FF3008?logo=DoorDash&logoColor=white)](#), preferring it over [![Uber Eats](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uber_Eats-5FB709?logo=uber-eats&logoColor=white)](#) and [![Just Eat](https://img.shields.io/badge/Just%20Eat-F36D00?logo=justeat&logoColor=fff)](#), but that's just my preference.
