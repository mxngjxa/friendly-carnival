# 🌟 About Me

Hi, I'm Jacky. I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Deledao](https://www.deledao.com) and recently graduated from [Fei Tian College - Northern Campus](https://feitian.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science, *Magna Cum Laude*.

I am passionate about technology, leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems, and continuously expanding my technical skill set. While I mainly focus on the engineering aspect of Machine Learning, I'm no stranger to DevOps, Full-Stack, the list goes on. 

Since I'm still early in my career, there is a lot to learn from the field. I will continue my education by pursuing a [MS in Quantum Computing](https://qc.northernonline.org/) to stay ahead of the curve while striving to be a part in revolutionizing the K-12 Ed-Tech landscape with Machine Learning.

## However...

This is my website, so I will tell you more about myself. I believe in making the world a better place, something that always starts at the individual level. 

:::


Practicing [Falun Dafa](https://faluninfo.net/what-is-falun-gong-falun-dafa/), an ancient spiritual practice rooted in Buddhism, has strengthened my resolve in doing what is right in the current state of affairs. 

On a social level, I've written for the health department at [The Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/author/mingjia-jacky-guan) on topics such as immune exhaustion, soaring egg prices, and everything else in-between. 

At the academic level, I enjoy helping peers and students with their work as an instructor and drafting up lecture notes for the next batch of undergraduates. After putting my DevOps experience to good use at [Sunregen Healthcare AG](sunregen.com), contracting as a system administrator, I am now serving as a Technical Solutions Architect at my own company, [MG Solutions](solutions.mguan.org). [Reach out to me](qmd/contact.qmd) and let's grab a (virtual) coffee to see how I can help you automate and scale your business.

At the same time, I've been skiing since 2008 and run my own little [channel](https://www.ganjingworld.com/s/Dvjmz0zQy3) where you can check out my videos. 


# 🛠️ Technical Aspects

Work nowadays is supercharged by AI. I use [![Perplexity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Perplexity-1FB8CD?logo=perplexity&logoColor=fff)](#) to accelerate my workflow as it includes the latest models from 
[![ChatGPT](https://img.shields.io/badge/ChatGPT-74aa9c?logo=openai&logoColor=white)](#), 
[![Claude](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude-D97757?logo=claude&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Deepseek](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Deepseek-4D6BFF?logo=deepseek&logoColor=fff)](#),
and 
[![Google Gemini](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Gemini-886FBF?logo=googlegemini&logoColor=fff)](#)
I frequently browse [![Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugging%20Face-FFD21E?logo=huggingface&logoColor=000)](#)
for other models to tune and deploy. Using 
[![Arc](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arc-FCBFBD?logo=arc&logoColor=000)](#)
has made tab management a breeze. I primarily work on [![AWS](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?logo=aws&logoColor=white)](#)
but have my fair share of experience on [![Google Cloud](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Cloud-%234285F4.svg?logo=google-cloud&logoColor=white)](#)
and am currently deploying this website using [![Netlify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netlify-%23000000.svg?logo=netlify&logoColor=#00C7B7)](#). While it is tempting to switch over to [![PyCharm](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyCharm-000?logo=pycharm&logoColor=fff)](#)
or become a hardcore and use [![Neovim](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neovim-57A143?logo=neovim&logoColor=fff)](#), I'm still more than happy with [![Visual Studio Code](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?logo=vsc&logoColor=white)](#)
and the incredible compatibility it offers. Maybe I can try out [![Cursor](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Cursor-000000?logo=cursor-ai-white)](#) or 
[![Windsurf](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windsurf-0B100F?logo=windsurf&logoColor=fff)](#)
to catch up to the hype train, but for now I will still try to be a traditional coder.

Technically speaking, I'm not experienced with anything special. You can see [![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-4479A1?logo=mysql&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postgres-%23316192.svg?logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)](#), and 
[![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-%2307405e.svg?logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)](#), along with a bunch of methods and frameworks on there like [![Apache Spark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Spark-E25A1C?logo=apachespark&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Matplotlib](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Matplotlib-71D291?logo=matplotlib&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/NumPy-4DABCF?logo=numpy&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-150458?logo=pandas&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-scikit--learn-%23F7931E?logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)](#), 
using tools like [![Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=fff)](#), 
workflows like [![ETL](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/ETL-9370DB?logo=etl-logo&logoColor=fff)](#), and more. While I manage my tasks using 
[![Notion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notion-000?logo=notion&logoColor=fff)](#)
and making things on the side using [![Canva](https://img.shields.io/badge/Canva-%2300C4CC.svg?&logo=Canva&logoColor=white)](#) I've learned a lot using [![Coursera](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coursera-0056D2?logo=coursera&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![freeCodeCamp](https://img.shields.io/badge/freeCodeCamp-0A0A23?logo=freecodecamp&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![GeeksForGeeks](https://img.shields.io/badge/GeeksforGeeks-298D46?logo=geeksforgeeks&logoColor=white)](#), 
[![W3Schools](https://img.shields.io/badge/W3Schools-04AA6D?logo=w3schools&logoColor=fff)](#), 
and have tried out the occasional competition on [![Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF?logo=kaggle&logoColor=fff)](#).

If we're going back to the technical side of things, of course I use [![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?logo=docker&logoColor=fff)](#)
and am intimidated by [![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-326CE5?logo=kubernetes&logoColor=fff)](#), but that is just the beginning of it. While I was never a huge fan of deploying websites with [![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-black?logo=next.js&logoColor=white)](#), [![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-%2320232a.svg?logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)](#), 
[![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind%20CSS-%2338B2AC.svg?logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)](#), [![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vite-646CFF?logo=vite&logoColor=fff)](#), [![Three.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Three.js-000?logo=threedotjs&logoColor=fff)](#), 
and [![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-6DA55F?logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](#), 
frameworks like [![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-ee4c2c?logo=pytorch&logoColor=white)](#)
and [![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-ff8f00?logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white)](#), 
or scraping the web with [![Selenium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Selenium-43B02A?logo=selenium&logoColor=fff)](#). I'm even thinking of writing a package and publishing it to [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPI-3775A9?logo=pypi&logoColor=fff)](#). 
Of course, while [![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-000000?logo=apple&logoColor=F0F0F0)](#)
offers the best UI experience with good old [![Homebrew](https://img.shields.io/badge/Homebrew-FBB040?logo=homebrew&logoColor=fff)](#), 
I work mostly in [![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?logo=linux&logoColor=black)](#), 
staying close to traditional flavors like [![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white)](#). In any case, something about [![Windows](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Windows-0078D6?logo=windows11&logoColor=white)](#)
creeps me out. 

At the core, I code mostly with [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=fff)](#). It is a good language, unlike [![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-%23276DC3.svg?logo=r&logoColor=white)](#), 
and much preferred over, [![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=000)](#)
(or [![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?logo=typescript&logoColor=fff)](#), since it is the way to go). I'm familiar with [![Bash](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash-4EAA25?logo=gnubash&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-%23ED8B00.svg?logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)](#), 
and of couse a fair bit of [![Markdown](https://img.shields.io/badge/Markdown-%23000000.svg?logo=markdown&logoColor=white)](#) 
and [![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/LaTeX-008080?logo=latex&logoColor=fff)](#)
to write those docs, but my goal is to learn [![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-%2300ADD8.svg?&logo=go&logoColor=white)](#)
to be much faster. 

Of course, I use [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-%23121011.svg?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/mxngjxa) and [![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?logo=git&logoColor=fff)](#), but not any of those common social media platforms like [![Instagram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Instagram-%23E4405F.svg?logo=Instagram&logoColor=white)](#), 
[![Facebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Facebook-%231877F2.svg?logo=Facebook&logoColor=white)](#), 
or [![X](https://img.shields.io/badge/X-%23000000.svg?logo=X&logoColor=white)](https://x.com/mxngjxa9). While I have accounts there, you will barely see me posting anything 
in any case. 



Please follow me on [![LinkedIn](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/LinkedIn-0A66C2?logo=linkedin-white&logoColor=fff)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mingjia-jacky-guan/). It's always intersting that even payment methods like [![Apple Pay](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apple%20Pay-000?logo=applepay&logoColor=fff)](#), [![MasterCard](https://img.shields.io/badge/MasterCard-EB001B?logo=mastercard&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Visa](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visa-1A1F71?logo=visa&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![American Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/American%20Express-2E77BC?logo=americanexpress&logoColor=fff)](#), 
and [![PayPal](https://img.shields.io/badge/PayPal-003087?logo=paypal&logoColor=fff)](#)
all get their own badges. I'm a fan of [![Doordash](https://img.shields.io/badge/DoorDash-FF3008?logo=DoorDash&logoColor=white)](#), preferring it over [![Uber Eats](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uber_Eats-5FB709?logo=uber-eats&logoColor=white)](#) and [![Just Eat](https://img.shields.io/badge/Just%20Eat-F36D00?logo=justeat&logoColor=fff)](#), but that's just my preference. These badges are fun to play around with...
