# üåü About Me

Hi, I'm Jacky. I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Deledao](https://www.deledao.com) and recently graduated from [Fei Tian College - Middletown](https://feitian.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science, *Magna Cum Laude*. 

I am passionate about technology, leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems, and continuously expanding my technical skill set. While I mainly focus on the engineering aspect of Machine Learning, I'm no stranger to DevOps, Full-Stack, and engineering. 

Since I'm still early in my career, there is a lot to learn from the field. I will continue my education by pursuing a [MS in Quantum Computing](https://qc.northernonline.org/) to stay ahead of the curve while striving to be a part in revolutionizing the K-12 Ed-Tech landscape with Machine Learning.

## However...

This is my website, so I will tell you more about myself. I believe in making the world a better place, something that always starts at the individual level. 

:::


Practicing [Falun Dafa](https://faluninfo.net/what-is-falun-gong-falun-dafa/), an ancient spiritual practice rooted in Buddhism, has strengthened my resolve in doing what is right in the current state of affairs. 

On a social level, I've written for the health department @[The Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/author/mingjia-jacky-guan) on topics such as immune exhaustion, soaring egg prices, and everything else in-between. 

At the academic level, I enjoy helping peers and students with their work as a Teaching Assistent and drafting up lecture notes for the next batch of undergraduates. I was able to put my DevOps experience to good use @[Sunregen Healthcare AG](sunregen.com), contracting as a system administrator.

At the same time, I've been skiing since 2008 and run my own little [channel](https://www.ganjingworld.com/s/Dvjmz0zQy3) where you can check out my videos. 


# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Aspects

Work nowadays is supercharged by AI. I use [![Perplexity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Perplexity-1FB8CD?logo=perplexity&logoColor=fff)](#) to accelerate my workflow as it includes the latest models from 
[![ChatGPT](https://img.shields.io/badge/ChatGPT-74aa9c?logo=openai&logoColor=white)](#), 
[![Claude](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude-D97757?logo=claude&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Deepseek](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Deepseek-4D6BFF?logo=deepseek&logoColor=fff)](#),
and 
[![Google Gemini](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Gemini-886FBF?logo=googlegemini&logoColor=fff)](#)
I frequently browse [![Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugging%20Face-FFD21E?logo=huggingface&logoColor=000)](#)
for other models to tune and deploy. Using 
[![Arc](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arc-FCBFBD?logo=arc&logoColor=000)](#)
has made tab management a breeze. I primarily work on [![AWS](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?logo=aws&logoColor=white)](#)
but have my fair share of experience on [![Google Cloud](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Cloud-%234285F4.svg?logo=google-cloud&logoColor=white)](#)
and am currently deploying this website using [![Netlify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netlify-%23000000.svg?logo=netlify&logoColor=#00C7B7)](#). While it is tempting to switch over to [![PyCharm](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyCharm-000?logo=pycharm&logoColor=fff)](#)
or become a hardcore and use [![Neovim](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neovim-57A143?logo=neovim&logoColor=fff)](#), I'm still more than happy with [![Visual Studio Code](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?logo=vsc&logoColor=white)](#)
and the incredible compatibility it offers. Maybe I can try out [![Cursor](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Cursor-000000?logo=cursor-ai-white)](#) or 
[![Windsurf](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windsurf-0B100F?logo=windsurf&logoColor=fff)](#)
to catch up to the hype train, but for now I will still try to be a traditional coder.

Technically speaking, I'm not experienced with anything special. You can see [![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-4479A1?logo=mysql&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postgres-%23316192.svg?logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)](#), and 
[![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-%2307405e.svg?logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)](#), along with a bunch of methods and frameworks on there like [![Apache Spark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Spark-E25A1C?logo=apachespark&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Matplotlib](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Matplotlib-71D291?logo=matplotlib&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/NumPy-4DABCF?logo=numpy&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-150458?logo=pandas&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-scikit--learn-%23F7931E?logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)](#), 
using tools like [![Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=fff)](#), 
workflows like [![ETL](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/ETL-9370DB?logo=etl-logo&logoColor=fff)](#), and more. While I manage my tasks using 
[![Notion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notion-000?logo=notion&logoColor=fff)](#)
and making things on the side using [![Canva](https://img.shields.io/badge/Canva-%2300C4CC.svg?&logo=Canva&logoColor=white)](#) I've learned a lot using [![Coursera](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coursera-0056D2?logo=coursera&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![freeCodeCamp](https://img.shields.io/badge/freeCodeCamp-0A0A23?logo=freecodecamp&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![GeeksForGeeks](https://img.shields.io/badge/GeeksforGeeks-298D46?logo=geeksforgeeks&logoColor=white)](#), 
[![W3Schools](https://img.shields.io/badge/W3Schools-04AA6D?logo=w3schools&logoColor=fff)](#), 
and have tried out the occasional competition on [![Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF?logo=kaggle&logoColor=fff)](#).

If we're going back to the technical side of things, of course I use [![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?logo=docker&logoColor=fff)](#)
and am intimidated by [![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-326CE5?logo=kubernetes&logoColor=fff)](#), but that is just the beginning of it. While I was never a huge fan of deploying websites with [![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-black?logo=next.js&logoColor=white)](#), [![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-%2320232a.svg?logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)](#), 
[![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind%20CSS-%2338B2AC.svg?logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)](#), [![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vite-646CFF?logo=vite&logoColor=fff)](#), [![Three.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Three.js-000?logo=threedotjs&logoColor=fff)](#), 
and [![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-6DA55F?logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](#), 
frameworks like [![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-ee4c2c?logo=pytorch&logoColor=white)](#)
and [![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-ff8f00?logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white)](#), 
or scraping the web with [![Selenium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Selenium-43B02A?logo=selenium&logoColor=fff)](#). I'm even thinking of writing a package and publishing it to [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPI-3775A9?logo=pypi&logoColor=fff)](#). 
Of course, while [![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-000000?logo=apple&logoColor=F0F0F0)](#)
offers the best UI experience with good old [![Homebrew](https://img.shields.io/badge/Homebrew-FBB040?logo=homebrew&logoColor=fff)](#), 
I work mostly in [![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?logo=linux&logoColor=black)](#), 
staying close to traditional flavors like [![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white)](#). In any case, something about [![Windows](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Windows-0078D6?logo=windows11&logoColor=white)](#)
creeps me out. 

At the core, I code mostly with [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=fff)](#). It is a good language, unlike [![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-%23276DC3.svg?logo=r&logoColor=white)](#), 
and much preferred over, [![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=000)](#)
(or [![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?logo=typescript&logoColor=fff)](#), since it is the way to go). I'm familiar with [![Bash](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash-4EAA25?logo=gnubash&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-%23ED8B00.svg?logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)](#), 
and of couse a fair bit of [![Markdown](https://img.shields.io/badge/Markdown-%23000000.svg?logo=markdown&logoColor=white)](#) 
and [![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/LaTeX-008080?logo=latex&logoColor=fff)](#)
to write those docs, but my goal is to learn [![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-%2300ADD8.svg?&logo=go&logoColor=white)](#)
to be much faster. 

Of course, I use [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-%23121011.svg?logo=github&logoColor=white)](#) and [![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?logo=git&logoColor=fff)](#), but not any of those common social media platforms like [![Instagram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Instagram-%23E4405F.svg?logo=Instagram&logoColor=white)](#), 
[![Facebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Facebook-%231877F2.svg?logo=Facebook&logoColor=white)](#), 
or [![X](https://img.shields.io/badge/X-%23000000.svg?logo=X&logoColor=white)](#). While I have accounts there, you will barely see me posting anything 
in any case. 



Please follow me on [![LinkedIn](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/LinkedIn-0A66C2?logo=linkedin-white&logoColor=fff)](www.linkedin.com/in/mingjia-jacky-guan). It's always intersting that even payment methods like [![Apple Pay](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apple%20Pay-000?logo=applepay&logoColor=fff)](#), [![MasterCard](https://img.shields.io/badge/MasterCard-EB001B?logo=mastercard&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![Visa](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visa-1A1F71?logo=visa&logoColor=fff)](#), 
[![American Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/American%20Express-2E77BC?logo=americanexpress&logoColor=fff)](#), 
and [![PayPal](https://img.shields.io/badge/PayPal-003087?logo=paypal&logoColor=fff)](#)
all get their own badges. I'm a fan of [![Doordash](https://img.shields.io/badge/DoorDash-FF3008?logo=DoorDash&logoColor=white)](#), preferring it over [![Uber Eats](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uber_Eats-5FB709?logo=uber-eats&logoColor=white)](#) and [![Just Eat](https://img.shields.io/badge/Just%20Eat-F36D00?logo=justeat&logoColor=fff)](#), but that's just my preference. These badges are fun to play around with...
