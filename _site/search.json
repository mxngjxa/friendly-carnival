    "text": "🌟 About Me\nHi, I’m Jacky. I’m a Machine Learning Engineer at Deledao and recently graduated from Fei Tian College - Northern Campus with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science, Magna Cum Laude.\nI am passionate about technology, leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems, and continuously expanding my technical skill set. While I mainly focus on the engineering aspect of Machine Learning, I’m no stranger to DevOps, Full-Stack, the list goes on.\nSince I’m still early in my career, there is a lot to learn from the field. I will continue my education by pursuing a MS in Quantum Computing to stay ahead of the curve while striving to be a part in revolutionizing the K-12 Ed-Tech landscape with Machine Learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHowever…\n\n\n\nThis is my website, so I will tell you more about myself. I believe in making the world a better place, something that always starts at the individual level.\n\n\nPracticing Falun Dafa, an ancient spiritual practice rooted in Buddhism, has strengthened my resolve in doing what is right in the current state of affairs.\nOn a social level, I’ve written for the health department at The Epoch Times on topics such as immune exhaustion, soaring egg prices, and everything else in-between.\nAt the academic level, I enjoy helping peers and students with their work as an instructor and drafting up lecture notes for the next batch of undergraduates. After putting my DevOps experience to good use at Sunregen Healthcare AG, contracting as a system administrator, I am now serving as a Technical Solutions Architect at my own company, MG Solutions. Reach out to me and let’s grab a (virtual) coffee to see how I can help you automate and scale your business.\n\n\n\nStowe 2025\n\n\nAt the same time, I’ve been skiing since 2008 and run my own little channel where you can check out my videos.\n\n\n🛠️ Technical Aspects\nWork nowadays is supercharged by AI. I use  to accelerate my workflow as it includes the latest models from , , , and  I frequently browse  for other models to tune and deploy. Using  has made tab management a breeze. I primarily work on  but have my fair share of experience on  and am currently deploying this website using . While it is tempting to switch over to  or become a hardcore and use , I’m still more than happy with  and the incredible compatibility it offers. Maybe I can try out  or  to catch up to the hype train, but for now I will still try to be a traditional coder.\nTechnically speaking, I’m not experienced with anything special. You can see , , and , along with a bunch of methods and frameworks on there like , , , , , using tools like , workflows like , and more. While I manage my tasks using  and making things on the side using  I’ve learned a lot using , , , , and have tried out the occasional competition on .\nIf we’re going back to the technical side of things, of course I use  and am intimidated by , but that is just the beginning of it. While I was never a huge fan of deploying websites with , , , , , and , frameworks like  and , or scraping the web with . I’m even thinking of writing a package and publishing it to . Of course, while  offers the best UI experience with good old , I work mostly in , staying close to traditional flavors like . In any case, something about  creeps me out.\nAt the core, I code mostly with . It is a good language, unlike , and much preferred over,  (or , since it is the way to go). I’m familiar with , , and of couse a fair bit of  and  to write those docs, but my goal is to learn  to be much faster.\nOf course, I use  and , but not any of those common social media platforms like , , or . While I have accounts there, you will barely see me posting anything in any case.\nPlease follow me on . It’s always intersting that even payment methods like , , , , and  all get their own badges. I’m a fan of , preferring it over  and , but that’s just my preference. These badges are fun to play around with…\n\n\n📧 Contact\n\nEmail: mingjia.guan@outlook.com\nLinkedIn: Mingjia “Jacky” Guan"
