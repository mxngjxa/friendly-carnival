    "text": "Hi, I’m Jacky. I’m a Machine Learning Engineer at Deledao and recently graduated from Fei Tian College - Middletown with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science, Magna Cum Laude.\nI am passionate about technology, leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems, and continuously expanding my technical skill set. While I mainly focus on the engineering aspect of Machine Learning, I’m no stranger to DevOps, Full-Stack, and engineering.\nSince I’m still early in my career, there is a lot to learn from the field. I will continue my education by pursuing a MS in Quantum Computing to stay ahead of the curve while striving to be a part in revolutionizing the K-12 Ed-Tech landscape with Machine Learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever…\n\n\n\nThis is my website, so I will tell you more about myself. I believe in making the world a better place, something that always starts at the individual level.\n\n\nPracticing Falun Dafa, an ancient spiritual practice rooted in Buddhism, has strengthened my resolve in doing what is right in the current state of affairs.\nOn a social level, I’ve written for the health department @The Epoch Times on topics such as immune exhaustion, soaring egg prices, and everything else in-between.\nAt the academic level, I enjoy helping peers and students with their work as a Teaching Assistent and drafting up lecture notes for the next batch of undergraduates. I was able to put my DevOps experience to good use @Sunregen Healthcare AG, contracting as a system administrator.\n\n\n\nStowe 2025\n\n\nAt the same time, I’ve been skiing since 2008 and run my own little channel where you can check out my videos."
